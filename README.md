# ext-imap-polyfill

A drop-in polyfill for the `imap_*` functions removed from PHP core in 8.4.

PHP 8.4 moved `ext-imap` out of core and onto PECL ([RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/unbundle_imap_pspell_oci8)). The C library it wraps (c-client) has been unmaintained since 2007 and is disappearing from Linux distributions, so installing the PECL package is getting harder every release. Codebases built on the `imap_*` functions are usually rewritten against an OOP library like [webklex/php-imap](https://github.com/Webklex/php-imap) instead — a real migration effort, not a version bump.

This package lets you skip that rewrite for the common cases: it defines the same global `imap_*` functions, backed by webklex/php-imap for IMAP and a small raw client for POP3, and only activates if `ext-imap` isn't already loaded. **IMAP and POP3** — unlike the real extension, it doesn't speak NNTP.

## Install

```bash
composer require fain182/ext-imap-polyfill
```

No code changes. If `ext-imap` is present (e.g. you're still on PHP 8.3), the polyfill is a no-op — safe to add before you upgrade, not just after.

Requires PHP 8.1+. The webklex/php-imap dependency declares a handful of extension requirements (`ext-mbstring`, `ext-iconv`, `ext-openssl`, `ext-libxml`, `ext-json`, `ext-fileinfo`, `ext-zip`); all but `ext-zip` are enabled in virtually every PHP build. `ext-zip` is only used by webklex code paths this polyfill never calls, so if you can't (or don't want to) install it:

```bash
composer require fain182/ext-imap-polyfill --ignore-platform-req=ext-zip
```

The package declares `provide: ext-imap`, so other dependencies that require `ext-imap` install cleanly alongside it.

## Usage

Your existing `imap_*` code runs unchanged:

```php
$imap = imap_open('{imap.example.com:993/imap/ssl}INBOX', 'user@example.com', $password);

foreach (imap_search($imap, 'UNSEEN') ?: [] as $msgno) {
    $overview = imap_fetch_overview($imap, (string) $msgno)[0];
    echo "{$overview->from}: {$overview->subject}\n";
}

imap_close($imap);
```

### Connection string flags

In the `{host[:port][/flag...]}folder` mailbox spec, the flags that change behavior are:

- `/ssl` — implicit TLS
- `/tls` — STARTTLS
- `/novalidate-cert` — skip TLS certificate validation
- `/pop3` — connect over POP3 instead of IMAP
- `/readonly` — open the mailbox read-only, same as passing `OP_READONLY`

When no port is given, the default follows the service and encryption, like c-client: IMAP 143 (993 with `/ssl`), POP3 110 (995 with `/ssl`).

Any other flag (`/imap`, `/norsh`, `/secure`, `/debug`, …) is accepted and ignored, so existing connection strings parse fine.

## Coverage

This is not a reimplementation of all `imap_*` functions — **65 of 75 (87%)** are implemented, chosen to cover the common path of connecting, reading, and moderating a mailbox. The missing ten are ACL and quota management (`imap_getacl`, `imap_setacl`, `imap_get_quota`, `imap_get_quotaroot`, `imap_set_quota`), scanning mailboxes by text content (`imap_scan`, `imap_scanmailbox`, `imap_listscan`), and outbound mail (`imap_mail`, `imap_mail_compose`). Calling any of them will simply hit PHP's "undefined function" error, same as before this package existed.

Every implemented function's object/array shape (property names, casing, flag semantics) is checked against the real extension — see [Verifying against real ext-imap](#verifying-against-real-ext-imap) below. Known, deliberate divergences are called out in the notes column; anything not noted is expected to match exactly.

| Function | Implemented | Notes |

| `imap_binary` | ✅ | wraps output at 60 chars/line like c-client's `rfc822_binary` |
| `imap_body` | ✅ |  |
| `imap_bodystruct` | ✅ | msgno-only, never uid — c-client's `mail_body()` has no UID equivalent, unlike `imap_fetchbody()` |
| `imap_check` | ✅ | `Mailbox` property echoes the input spec rather than the c-client-normalized form |

| `imap_fetch_overview` | ✅ | |
| `imap_fetchstructure` | ✅ | |

| `imap_mail_compose` | ❌ | |
| `imap_mail_copy` | ✅ |  |
| `imap_mail_move` | ✅ | copies and marks the source `\Deleted` without expunging, like c-client; target is a bare folder name |

| `imap_ping` | ✅ |  |
| `imap_qprint` | ✅ | |
| `imap_rename` | ✅ | |
| `imap_renamemailbox` | ✅ | |
| `imap_reopen` | ✅ | only switches folders on the same connection — can't reconnect to a different host, since credentials aren't retained after `imap_open` |
| `imap_rfc822_parse_adrlist` | ✅ | |
| `imap_rfc822_parse_headers` | ✅ | |
| `imap_rfc822_write_address` | ✅ | |

## Limitations

Cross-cutting divergences from the real extension (per-function ones are in the coverage table's notes column):

- **No NNTP**: `{host/nntp}` is parsed but ignored — the connection silently falls back to IMAP instead of talking NNTP.
- **POP3** support mirrors real ext-imap's own treatment of POP3: a single mailbox always named `INBOX`, `SEARCH`/`STATUS`/`BODYSTRUCTURE` synthesized client-side, flags lasting only for the lifetime of the connection, and copy/move/append/mailbox-management failing outright. The one divergence: `imap_search()`'s criteria grammar over POP3 is a practical subset (`ALL`, the `SEEN`/`ANSWERED`/`DELETED`/`FLAGGED` pairs, `FROM`/`TO`/`SUBJECT`/`BODY`/`TEXT` substring match, `SINCE`/`BEFORE`/`ON`), not the full RFC3501 grammar.
- **Warnings** are raised as `E_USER_WARNING`, not `E_WARNING` — userland code can't raise the exact error level the C extension uses.

## Development

```bash
make install          # composer install
make test-unit        # pure-PHP tests, no server needed
make test-integration  # spins up a disposable Greenmail IMAP+POP3 server, runs the full suite against it
make test              # both of the above
```

Docker or Podman is required for `test-integration` (a `docker-compose.yml` is included for the equivalent setup with compose tooling).

### Verifying against real ext-imap

`make parity` runs the exact same integration suite a second time, in a PHP 8.3 container with the genuine `ext-imap` extension installed from source, against the same Greenmail fixture. This is the real check that this polyfill's shapes and behavior actually match the extension it's replacing, not just internally-consistent test assertions.

```bash
make parity
```

This requires building a container image (`Dockerfile.parity`) the first time, which takes a few minutes.
